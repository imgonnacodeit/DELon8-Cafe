**MINIPROJECT: City High Café**
City High Café a popular South London Café wanted an app that would meet all of their business needs. Initially the requirements were relatively simple in the onset of the project; however, the complexity in their requirements grew over the number of weeks. The requirements developed as such:

_WEEK 1_
The client focused on the inventory side of the app. They required the app view all products available, create a new product, delete a product, and update a product. All products were stored in working memory in a list.

_WEEK 2_
Commencing week 2 the client started to focus on the orders aspect of the app. The required that the data be stored in a two-dimensional format (dictionary). The app was required to create an order, delete view all orders and update specific entries to the orders. 

_WEEK 3_
The client now required some data persistence these were done in .txt files. The client also required a new data for their couriers which as with the products and orders needed to be viewed in its entirety, created, updated, and deleted. The persisted data was required to be loaded into the program to ensure that continuity of the app.

_WEEK 4_
Client requested that the app to be refactored. The price was added to the products list and a phone number for the courier. The persisted data had to be stored in .csv format and unlike previous weeks data from the orders list needed to be persisted. The couriers and the products ordered were to be assigned to a specific order. And the client also wanted the orders to be arranged by either order status or courier number.

_WEEK 5 & 6_
The client would now like the app to connect to a database.
This will be implemented in the coming weeks. 


**How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?**
To ensure that I met the projects requirements I aimed to meet the core functionality of the app as simply as possible. Upon receiving the initial criteria, I did start coding almost immediately. However, upon receiving week 2 I realised the fluidity of the program and how the requirements could change; knowing this I set out to only build upon what the client wanted in the manner that they wanted. The simplicity maintained through the app in the initial stages allowed it to develop naturally. 

**How did you guarantee the project's requirements?**
Flexibility was crucial to ensure that the specified requirements were met. As the client's needs and requirements changed so did the structure and the code. The requirements of the project were then ensured using unit tests for the core functionality of the application. This ensured that the clients got what they required. This would also help with future troubleshooting of the application should any problems arise.

**If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?**
I would design the project using object-oriented programming. It would allow me to produce a system that is more apt to change. There were allot of changes in the client’s requirements throughout the weeks this method of programming would have allowed me the most versatility to implement those changes without requiring changing the code as much as I had to throughout the process. 
Given more time (assuming that this would have been the final product) I would continue to implement the following solutions:
Core functionality. Currently the product price can be given to an infinite number of decimal places this obviously would be rectified to only allow the user to input a number with 2 decimal places. Likewise, the phone number is not restricted to a specific set of digits that can be entered.
I would put the menu into a function and ensure that all inputs were restricted and had the appropriate measures to ensure the program continued to run even though 
Ensuring that higher level testing is done. I would have ensured that there was automated-integration and system testing. Although unit tests were completed for each function their interaction as a complete system may could cause system failure; especially if there were further developments to be had on the project.
Knowing that the client would like their data to be persisted to databases I would look to ensure that this happened using SQL servers in a relational database.

**What did you most enjoy implementing?**
I thoroughly enjoyed the range of things that I had to produce on this project. Unit testing fast became something I enjoyed. Also the opportunity for attempting OOP was too great to pass up and although I was not able to implement it did deepen my understanding of the concept. 
Most of all I enjoyed the subtle changes and developments in the requirements from the clients. It allowed me to plan and prepare accurately for what would come next.
