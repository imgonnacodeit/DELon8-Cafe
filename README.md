Project Background
Client requirements:
The client required some core functionalities these were.




How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?


How did you guarantee the project's requirements?


If I had more time there are several things that I would improve on:
1. I would design the project using object oriented programming. It would allow me to produce a system that is more apt to change. There were alot of 
changes in the clients requirements throughout the weeks this method of programming would have allowed me the most versitility.
2. I would have ensured that there was automated-intergration and system testing. Although unit teststing was compledted for each function their 
interaction as a complete system may have caused the system to crash; especially if there were further developments to be had on the project. 

I thoughrouly enjoyed the implementaion of the project.
